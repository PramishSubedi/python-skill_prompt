# here we are calculating the area of a circle

# at first we will define the value of the radius
# i am using my favourite nuumber but we can change this number to any value we want
radius = 6

#now we will calculate the area using the formula: Ï€ Ã— radius Ã— radius
# we use 3.14159 as an approximate value for Ï€ (pi)
area = 3.14159 * radius * radius

# this line prints the result with the given message
print("The area of a circle with radius", radius, "is>", area)
